## Synopsis

This project was inspired after reading [this](https://fortune-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/fortune.com/2023/06/09/startup-exit-japan-quit-job-for-you/amp/) article. Essentially, I wanted to create a similar service that could take in the information of a person who wanted to quit their job, and the service would process the data and "deliver" an email on their behalf. If this project was launched into the real world, I would probably utilize Amazon Pay and Amazon Simple Email Service, but as it is, this is just a quick home brew project that is only hosted locally.

## Lessons Learned
</div><div style="text-align: left">

1. Browsers don't like pulling CSV files without a server enabled.
2. How to parse a CSV file in Javascript.
3. There's more than one script type that can be accepted into the head section of an HTML file.
4. HTML's "font" tag has been deprecated in favor of CSS. Back in my day, we had to use font tags in the snow. Both ways.
5. An "await" before using sessionStorage.setItem() will save a lot of headache.
6. CORS errors. Nuff said.
